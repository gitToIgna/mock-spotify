This is an exercise given at Ironhack on week 5. 

I used a Spotify API and created a page where User can search albums and listen to sample audio. 

##Features included 
-Enter an artist name. 
-Album art and album names will appear.
-By clicking on the album, a list of track and a sample audio button will appear.
